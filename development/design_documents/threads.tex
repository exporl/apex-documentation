\section{Main}
:
there are 3 threads of interest, but a lot more of them are actually
running.
These 3 and their task are:

\begin{description}
\item[Main] main application thread (QApplication's): every object created runs in
this thread,
  it also runs the gui
\item[Control] ApexControlThread: used to wait asynchroneously on certain events in
order not to
  obstruct the main thread. Events are queued.
\item[Stimulus] DeviceCheckThread: waits for all devices to play their stimuli,
signals an object
  when this is done.
\end{description}

The other threads are eg the audio thread, the L34 thread, dialog threads etc.

Some definitions:
\begin{description}
\item[sync] a normal, blocking function call
\item[async] a non-blocking call, that is: the call returns immedeately after
triggering some event
         to do the actual wrk in another thread
\item[event] a data structure containing at least some kind of opcode and eventually
data (void*)
\end{description}

Note on signals/slots:

these are just function calls but about 10 times slower. Although the name
might give the impression it's something async, it is not.

\begin{verbatim}
connect( a( int ), b( int ) );
emit( a( 5) );
\end{verbatim}


is exactly the same as

\begin{verbatim}
b( 5 )
\end{verbatim}

but slower.

The cooperation between the 3 threads is quite simple:
Main starts up and starts Control and Stimulus. They are now waiting for things
to happen.
ApexMainWindow emits signals which are catched by slots in ApexControl.
These slots, instead of doing everything sync, tell Control to start waiting on
an event.
This is the most important reason for using Control: if it wasn't there,
everything had to
happen sync in Main so the screen was not repainted and user input was not
possible.
The event has 3 members: an event code from the tState enum, the time to wait
and eventually
the object to wait on.
Control adds the event to it's queue. If the queue was emtpy, Control signals
it's waitobject
to start the thread function; if there were already events in the queue, it does
nothing.
In Control's thread function events are dequeued and processed. If the event has
a waitobject,
the thread just waits for the object to be signaled, else it sleeps for the
given period.
When the wait is done, Control posts a QCustomEvent to ApexControl. See
QObject's docs for how
this is done. In response to the post, ApexControl's customEvent() is called,
the event code is resolved and appropriate actions are taken.
The only thing Stimulus does, is waiting for all devices. This waiting is
triggered by StimulusOutput
shen PlayStimulus(0 is called. When the devices are done, Stimulus signals it's
waitobject, which is at that time waited for in Control.



\section{Example Experiment Sequence}
This is an example sequence for ApexControl and ApexControlThread when an identification experiment runs.
No matter what kind of eperiment is used, it will mimic this sequence very close.
First an experiment is parsed and loaded in some way. When this succeeds, everything starts by calling
PrepareExperiment.
See figure~\ref{main} for the main signal flow of what happens next.

The first row lists the main participants.
Rows below list function calls, or descriptions of functions called (with a -)
An arrow (-> or <-) means a function call (direct, via signal/slot or through event loop).
Three dots (...) means idle time.
